## 4. Compatibility Justification
For each part, explain compatibility and choices.  
Example:  
- **CPU + Motherboard**: AMD Ryzen 5 5600X  is compatible with MSI B550M board (AM4 Socket, BIOS compatible).  Having the ability to overclock, combined with a strong 16 cores and 32 threads, the Ryzen 5 5600X is one of the best mid-range CPUs for gaming. It will be paired with the MSI B550M wifi. This mATX board is a strong budget option for entry-mid level PCs.
- **CPU Cooler**: This build features a water cooler that is able to fit within the case. The cooler is compatibile with AM4 slots and will be able to keep the CPU sufficiently cool, even if it is overclocking.
- **RAM**: DDR4 RAM is supported by the motherboard (maximum RAM is 128GB). This build has 32GB of RAM, which is a good amount for most heavy tasks such as gaming and video editing.
- **Storage**: This build boasts 1TB of storage, via a Samsung 990 Pro NVME M.2 SSD, which is supported by the motherboard.
- **GPU**: This build features an AMD Radeon RX 9060 XT. This GPU is a great choice for a budget GPU. With 16GB of VRAM and support for DirectX 12 Ultimate, this GPU is a solid option for most, if not all games currently available. It is especially good at running these tasks on 1080/1440p.
- **PSU**: With 650W, the GIGABYTE 650W GP-P650G 80+ Gold is a high quality PSU that will be more than enough to power this PC, and even accomodate future upgrades that may require more power.
- **Case**: The case used by the build has an E-ATX form factor which supports both the PSU's ATX form factor and the motherboards mATX form factor. It is also large enough to fit the GPU and the CPU cooler.

## 5. Budget Analysis
- **Budget Limit**: ₱60,000 (+-5%)  
- **Final Total**: ₱59,484  
- ✅ Within budget
- Notes on trade-offs (e.g., cheaper RAM, higher PSU wattage, no aftermarket cooler, etc.).
 - **No HDD** - The build has no hard disk drive. While this trades off some extra storage, 1TB should be enough for most purposes. Furthermore, the costs that would've went to buying an HDD was able to be dedicated for better performing parts such as the GPU.

 - **Higher Power PSU** - The build's PSU is much stronger than it has to be, and as a result is much more expensive. This is a worthy tradeoff because, while the extra money required for this PSU can be felt in other areas of the build, future upgrades will require a stronger wattage first and foremost. 

 - **Motherboard restricted to DDR4** - The build's motherboard is AM4, and thus does not support DDR5 RAM. While this adds another hurdle for upgrading the RAM of the build, keeping the motherboard on AM4 gives it access to powerful budget options such as the 5600X. This is a worthy tradeoff as this CPU and motherboard are more than enough for entry or even mid level gaming.

## 6. Conclusion & Learnings
Reflections on:  
- Price differences (international vs. Manila vendors)
  - International prices were higher than local prices for most components. Only the SSD and Graphics Card were more expensive locally than international prices, being ₱319.5 and ₱3,213.84 more expensive respectfully. So for the most part, local vendors offered cheaper prices, especially for major parts like the CPU, motherboard, and PSU costing at least ₱2000 less. This price advantage allowed us to build a more powerful system while still staying within our ₱60,000 budget.  
- Challenges in finding stock or cheaper equivalents
  - One of the main considerations was finding a cost-effective GPU, as performance did not always directly correlate with price. Some lower-priced models offered equal or even better performance than more expensive ones. Aside from that, there weren’t any major challenges in sourcing the parts since all components were readily available from well-known local PC vendors such as PC Express, DynaQuest, and VillMan. The parts were easy to search for, and listings were regularly updated. This convenience made the building process smoother and faster, allowing the group to focus more on optimization and budget balance rather than availability issues.
